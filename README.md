# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

In the future, I would like to enhance the website by adding accessibility improvements and making it fully responsive for mobile devices. Iâ€™m also interested in incorporating JavaScript to make the form interactive and validate input in real-time.
